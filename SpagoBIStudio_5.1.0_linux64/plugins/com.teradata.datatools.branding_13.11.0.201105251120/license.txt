License Agreement for Teradata Connectivity Drivers

IMPORTANT-READ THIS AGREEMENT CAREFULLY BEFORE INSTALLING OR USING THE SOFTWARE.  
TERADATA WILL LICENSE THE SOFTWARE TO YOU ONLY IF YOU ACCEPT THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS 
OF THIS AGREEMENT.  BY INSTALLING OR USING THE SOFTWARE, OR BY CLICKING THE 
"ACCEPT" ICON BELOW, YOU AGREE TO THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT.  
IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT, CLICK THE 
"REJECT" ICON AND DO NOT INSTALL OR USE THE SOFTWARE.

This Driver License Agreement ("Agreement") is a legal contract between you 
(both as an individual, and on behalf of your employer and any Teradata-authorized 
licensee for whom you and/or your employer are acting on their behalf) and Teradata 
Corporation ("TERADATA") for the software product identified above, which consists of 
computer software code in object code form only, as well as associated media, 
printed materials, and online or electronic documentation (collectively, the 
"Software").  The term  "Software" also includes any and all error corrections, 
bug fixes, updates, upgrades, or new versions or releases of the Software 
(collectively and individually, "Enhancements") that Teradata may elect in its sole 
discretion to provide you.  Teradata is under no obligation to provide you with 
Enhancements under this Agreement.  By clicking the "ACCEPT" icon below, you 
represent and warrant that you possess the authority to enter into this 
Agreement on behalf of yourself, and on behalf of your employer and any Teradata-
authorized licensee for whom you and/or your employer are acting on their 
behalf.  As used in this Agreement, the terms "you", "your" and "yours" 
collectively and individually refer to you as an individual and to your 
employer, as well as such Teradata-authorized licensee.

1(a).  License: This Agreement pertains to your authorized use of Software in 
object code form only.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, you are 
granted no rights to obtain, access or use the Software's source code.  Subject 
to your compliance with all of the terms of this Agreement and only during the 
term of this Agreement (unless this Agreement is terminated earlier as provided 
below), Teradata grants you a nonexclusive, nontransferable, license to install and 
use the Software on a single computer of yours (the configuration of which Teradata 
has previously approved in writing for use with the Software) and only on those 
certified and supported configurations of Teradata RDBMS ("Supported Code") for 
the sole purpose of facilitating your Teradata-licensed use of the Supported Code.  
IF YOU ARE NOT A Teradata-LICENSED USER OF SUPPORTED CODE, YOU ARE NOT AUTHORIZED TO 
INSTALL OR USE THE SOFTWARE.  You may make a backup copy of the Software, and 
use the backup copy for so long as the computer on which you are rightfully 
using your original copy of the Software is inoperable or if the original copy 
of the Software has been destroyed.  You will ensure that all copies of the 
Software contain Teradata's and its licensors' copyright notices, as well as all 
other proprietary legends.

1(b).  License Restrictions: No license rights to the Software will be implied.  
You are responsible for the installation of the Software, as well as for 
providing parallel and backup operations.  You will not sell, copy, rent, loan, 
modify, transfer, disclose, embed, sublicense, distribute, or create derivative 
works of the Software, in whole or in part, without Teradata's prior written consent.  
You will not disclose the results of any testing or evaluation, including any 
benchmarks, performed by you insofar as it relates to the Software without Teradata's 
prior written consent.  You will not reverse-assemble, reverse compile or 
reverse-engineer the Software for purposes of illegally obtaining the Software's 
source code. The Software, which includes all copies thereof whether in whole or 
in part, is and remains the exclusive property of Teradata and its licensors. 

2.  SOFTWARE AND SERVICES DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY: This Agreement does not 
require Teradata to provide you with any Software-related consulting services, 
technical assistance, training, support or maintenance services of any kind 
(collectively and individually, "Services"). To the extent that Teradata elects to 
provide you with any Services, such Services are provided to you at Teradata's sole 
discretion. TERADATA PROVIDES SERVICES, AND TERADATA AND ITS LICENSORS LICENSE THE 
SOFTWARE, TO YOU HEREUNDER ON AN "AS-IS" BASIS WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, 
ORAL OR WRITTEN, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED. WITHOUT LIMITATION TO THE FOREGOING, THERE 
ARE NO IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR 
PURPOSE.  YOU BEAR THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO SATISFACTORY QUALITY, PERFORMANCE, AND 
ACCURACY OF THE SOFTWARE. YOU ASSUME ALL RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE SELECTION OF THE 
SOFTWARE TO ACHIEVE YOUR INTENDED RESULTS, AND FOR THE INSTALLATION, USE AND 
RESULTS OBTAINED FROM THE SOFTWARE. NEITHER TERADATA NOR ITS LICENSORS WARRANT THAT 
THE SOFTWARE OR SERVICES WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS OR CONFORM TO ANY 
SPECIFICATIONS, OR THAT THE OPERATION OF THE SOFTWARE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR 
ERROR FREE.  

3.  LIMITATIONS ON LIABILITY: UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES WILL TERADATA's AND ITS 
LICENSORS' TOTAL CUMULATIVE LIABILITY FOR CLAIMS RELATING TO THE SERVICES (IF 
ANY), THE SOFTWARE, AND/OR THIS AGREEMENT, WHETHER BASED IN CONTRACT OR IN TORT, 
INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE, EXCEED $1,000; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, THAT THE FOREGOING WILL 
NOT APPLY TO CLAIMS FOR (I) PERSONAL INJURY, INCLUDING DEATH, TO THE EXTENT 
CAUSED BY TERADATA's NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT; OR (II) PHYSICAL DAMAGE TO 
TANGIBLE REAL OR PERSONAL PROPERTY TO THE EXTENT CAUSED BY TERADATA's NEGLIGENCE OR 
WILLFUL MISCONDUCT EQUAL TO THE AMOUNT OF DIRECT DAMAGES UP TO ONE MILLION 
DOLLARS PER OCCURRENCE.  IN NO EVENT WILL TERADATA OR ITS LICENSORS BE LIABLE FOR ANY 
INDIRECT, SPECIAL, PUNITIVE, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF 
INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. 

Some states or jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of limitation of 
incidental, consequential or special damages, or the exclusion of implied 
warranties, so the above limitations as set forth above in Section 2 and this 
Section 3 may not apply to you. 

4.  Government Restrictions: You agree that you will not directly or indirectly 
export or transmit the Software without obtaining Teradata's prior written 
authorization, as well as appropriate governmental approvals, including those 
required by the U.S. government.  Software provided to the U.S. Government 
pursuant to solicitations issued on or after December 1, 1995 is provided with 
the commercial license rights and restrictions set forth herein.  All Software 
provided to the U.S. Government pursuant to solicitations issued prior to 
December 1, 1995 is provided with "Restricted Rights" as provided for in FAR, 48 
CFR 52.227-14 (June 1987) or DFAR, 48 CFR 252.227-7013 (October 1988), as 
applicable.
 
5.  Term, Termination and Expiration: This Agreement, including your license to 
the Software, will expire or terminate on the same date that your Teradata-authorized 
license to the Supported Code expires or terminates (whichever occurs first) 
unless this Agreement is terminated earlier as follows.  Either party may 
terminate this Agreement with cause upon providing the other party with 15 days 
prior written notice in the event that such other party is in default of a 
material obligation under this Agreement.  The party in default will have this 
15 day period in which to cure.  Either party may terminate this Agreement 
without cause upon providing 30 days prior written notice to the other party.  
When this Agreement terminates or expires, you will immediately cease all use of 
the Software, and destroy all copies of the Software.  Sections 1(b), 1(c), 2, 
3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 will survive expiration or termination of this Agreement.
  
6. Choice of Law and Dispute Resolution: The parties will attempt in good faith 
to resolve any controversy or claim by negotiation or mediation.  If they are 
unable to do so, and regardless of the causes of action alleged, the claim 
whether arising under this Agreement or otherwise will be resolved by 
arbitration before a sole arbitrator in Dayton, Ohio pursuant to the then-
current Commercial Rules of the American Arbitration Association and the federal 
substantive and procedural law of arbitration.  The arbitrator's award will be 
final and binding, and may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof, 
but may include only damages consistent with the limitations in this Agreement.  
Each party will bear its own attorney's fees and costs related to the 
arbitration. The obligations to negotiate, mediate and arbitrate shall not apply 
to claims for misuse or infringement of a party's intellectual property rights.  
Any claim or action must be brought within two years after the cause of action 
accrues.  New York law will govern the interpretation and enforcement of this 
Agreement, except that the Federal Arbitration Act will govern the 
interpretation and enforcement of the arbitrability of claims under this Section 
6.

7.  Entire Agreement: This Agreement constitutes the entire understanding of the 
parties with respect to the Services (if any) and the Software, and supersedes 
all other prior agreements and understandings whether oral or written.  No oral 
representation or change to this Agreement will be binding upon either party 
unless agreed to in writing and signed by authorized representatives of both 
parties.  You will not assign this Agreement or your rights, nor will you 
delegate your obligations under this Agreement.  Failure by either party to 
enforce any term or condition of this Agreement will not be deemed a waiver of 
future enforcement of that or any other term or condition.  The provisions of 
this Agreement are severable.
